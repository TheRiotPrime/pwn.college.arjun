# Linux Luminarium- Hello Hackers
The challenge helps you get familiar with the command line and a few basic commands.

## My solve
### Challenge 1:
**Flag:** pwn.college{YosI6aiKcSrlC8tW9UgJ8XosHPK.QX3YjM1wyM0AzNzEzW}

Here we use type in the hello command to get the flag. The command is case sensitive and helllo is different from HELLO.
Here there are no arguments.
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YosI6aiKcSrlC8tW9UgJ8XosHPK.QX3YjM1wyM0AzNzEzW}
```
## What I learned
I learned about command line and that commands are case sensitive.

### Challenge 2:
**Flag:** pwn.college{AihucrkitjOomcK65GzTq1kEwg_.QX4YjM1wyM0AzNzEzW}
In a similar way, we can use the 'hello' command with the 'hackers' argument, to obtain the flag.
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AihucrkitjOomcK65GzTq1kEwg_.QX4YjM1wyM0AzNzEzW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ 
```
## What I learned
I learned that commands can be made more specific with arguments.Arguments customize the command as per requirement.

### Challenge 3:
**Flag:** pwn.college{07V76lIWG7hVz0m8NM8KBPODBXf.0lNzEzNxwyM0AzNzEzW}
Here we use the up arrow to recall previously written code line. It helps preventing restarting from scratch.
```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{07V76lIWG7hVz0m8NM8KBPODBXf.0lNzEzNxwyM0AzNzEzW}
bash: the: command not found
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ 
```
## What I learned
I learnt how Linux commands can take up  arguments and how these arguments can be altered to obtain different outputs in the terminal. I also learned the function of the 'echo' command, it shows the arguments we enter, back as output in the terminal.
